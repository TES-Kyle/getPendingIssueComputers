# getPendingIssueComputers

This gets computers who have 8 or more pending commands. Should be a pretty good show of computers with issues.

Have only tested with cloud instance. Put your instance name URL and an account that has access to the necessary info. Run it and gawk at the inefficient code. Will have touch and chmod the report.xml file.
